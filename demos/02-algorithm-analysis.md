## Why we analyse algorithm
- Time (processor time) and space (memory) analysis
- Counting how many instructions are being executed when solving a problem using an algorithm
    - Depends on the size of the problem (n)
        - For sorting it would be number of number to sort (n)

- Objective metric for time taken for solving a problem using a prticular algorithm
- We have multiple ways to solve the SAME problem. Which one should we choose?
    - No problem! We have the metric in terms of time (count of instructions)
